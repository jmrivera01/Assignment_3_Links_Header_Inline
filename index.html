    <h3><a href="quest2.html">Quest 2 Review</a></h3>
    <p>The Meta <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Quest 2</span> (formerly known as Oculus <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Quest 2</span>) is the best VR headset to buy for most people. It offers the most versatility and the best value in the most affordable package available.</p>
    <h3><a href="valve.html">Valve Index</a></h3> 
    <p>The <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Valve Index</span> is an old dog in this market, but <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Valve</span>'s first, and so far only, VR headset remains one of the best that money can buy today. Unfortunately, in terms of resolution, the <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Index</span> is lagging behind the rest of the market. The headset boasts dual 1440 x 1600 LCD panels for crisp but not mind-blowing image clarity. The variable refresh rate settings allow you to dial in displays to match your PC's performance, which is an incredible help when you have a less-powerful graphics card in your system. The <span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Index</span> supports 80, 90, 120, and 144 Hz configurations.</p>
